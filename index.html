            <h3>About</h3>
            <p>Senior at Chapman University pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Data Science with a themed inquiry in Africana Studies.
                I am passionate about learning how we can use the many tools within Machine Learning, Artificial Intelligence, and Deep Learning to solve complex problems. 
                I play on the men's lacrosse team at Chapman. In my free time, I like to play and compose music, exercise, and listen to audio books.</p>

            <h3>Projects</h3>
            <div class="flex-container">
                <div class="flex-item">NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING - LONG SHORT-TERM MEMORY NETWORK - NURSERY RHYME GENERATION<br> -Developed a NLP model using LSTM neural networks to generate sequences of tokenized words based on a corpus of nursery
                    rhymes.<br>-Preprocessed and cleaned text data by removing punctuation and converting words to lowercase for better model training.<br>
                    -Created a word-to-index mapping to represent unique words in the nursery rhymes, facilitating sequence generation and
                    model interpretation.<br>
                    -Utilized Keras deep learning library to build an LSTM model with 100 units, incorporating a dense layer with softmax activation
                    for word prediction.</div>
                <div class="flex-item">MySQL SERVER APPLICATION - E-COMMERCE SYSTEM<br> Developed a python script using the ‘mysql.connector’ library to interact with MySQL database for an e-commerce system.<br>
                    -Implemented functions to retrieve and display specific information from the database, such as products out of stock, total
                    orders by customer, details of the most expensive product in each order, products that have never been ordered, and total
                    revenue by each supplier.<br>
                    -Utilized SQL queries to extract relevant data from multiple tables, demonstrating strong database querying skills.<br>
                    -Created a user-friendly menu system allowing users to choose specific actions, enhancing the overall usability of the script.</div>
                <div class="flex-item">FEED FORWARD NEURAL NETWORK - MULTI CLASS CLASSIFICATION - FORMULA ONE OUTCOMES<br>-Developed a feed forward neural network using TensorFlow and Keras to predict the outcome of Formula One races based on
                    various features.<br>
                    -Preprocessed the dataset by transforming the target variable and features into one-hot encoded format for multi class
                    classification.<br>
                    -Utilized standard machine learning practices, including train-test splitting and feature scaling, to prepare the data for model
                    training.<br>
                    -Designed a neural network architecture with multiple hidden layers, incorporating batch normalization and dropout layers for
                    improved regularization and generalization.
                    -Implemented the model using TensorFlow’s Keras API, optimizing it with the Adam optimizer and using categorical
                    crossentropy as the loss function for multi class classification.</div>
              </div>
            <h3>Professional Experience</h3>
            <div class="flex-container">
                <div class="flex-item">
                    Financial Analyst Internship<br>Company: FORENSIC ANALYTICAL CONSULTING SERVICES<br>-Collaborated with CFO to develop profitability dashboard with data queried using SQL, and dashboard created using
                    HTML and CSS, used to present relevant findings to shareholders and officers.<br>
                    -Designed profitability dashboard to exhibit profitability margins across several types of contract types and revenue
                    sizes as well as other key variables and Implemented machine learning models like linear regression to display which
                    variables had the most significance on margins.
